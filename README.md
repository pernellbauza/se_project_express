# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Description of the project and it's functionality as well as the technologies and techniques used:
This project is designed to help you learn back-end programming. You will gain practical experience configuring REST APIs, managing errors, configuring controllers, models, and routes, as well as using Mongoose to link my project to an active server. I was able to use my newly acquired knowledge in this project to advance my career as an aspiring full-stack developer. By using package.json and.eslintrc.js, I was able to create customized rules and devDependencies and adhere to the best practices for ES6 implementation of , controllers, models, routes, and rest apis, as well as knowing when and how to use SQL and NoSQL.

## This project contains:
Generalized global error handling as a fail safe, as to when errors that might not be named come along to crash the party. Error status codes, so there aren't random numbers that are passed into the code. Use of the .orFail() method that allows you to throw custom errors in case those pesky errors don't want to be caught. A .eslintrc.js which is a configuration file for a tool name ESLINT, it is used for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
